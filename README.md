# Systems Engineering Study Group (SESG)

## Motivation

Hi, this is Archi! I am currently working as a **Site Reliability Engineer** and **Technical Account Manager** from India.

My long term goal is to achieve niche tech skills in the domain of Rust, Distributed Systems, Systems Engineering, MLOPs and Core Blockchain Engineering.

One of my main motivations backing this is : **permanently moving to the EU**.

Outside my office hours, I work on building stuff from scratch : like Operating Systems, Databases, WASM Runtimes, Container Interface Plugins, Ethereum node etc. in Rust / Zig / C, for educational purposes.

It's a long and hard journey. Being alone, makes it even harder!

I am gathering a few motivated people with similar mindset as of mine, into a group. I want the group to be small (10 - 15 members including me) and focused.

**Every Sunday, we meet and discuss with each other, whatever we've learnt (walk through the architecture and code, share the resources that we referenced, summarize chapters from a book etc.)**.

Being in a group, we motivate, get inspired and mutually benefit from each other.

## How we function

If you want to join our group, please open an issue in this repository.

I'll review your Github profile and if it seems nice, I'll send you an invite to join our Discord server.

The discord server has **a channel dedicated to each of the projects we're working on**, which currently are :

- Building a distributed (single master) SQL database from scratch, backed by an LSM / B+ Tree based KV storage engine.

- Building a RISCV based OS from scratch.

  > Building a TCP server from scratch is a sub-project of this.

- Building an eBPF based load-balancer from scratch.

Join each of those channels.

Also, do join the `#weekly-meet` channel, where, every week I :

- create a poll to decide the time slot, when everybody will meet on the weekend.

- post a summary of who'll be covering what in the meeting.
