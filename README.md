# Systems Engineering Study Group (SESG)

## Motivation

Hi, this is Archi! I am currently working as a **Site Reliability Engineer** and **Technical Account Manager** from India.

My long term goal is to achieve niche tech skills in the domain of Rust, Distributed Systems, Systems Engineering, MLOPs and Core Blockchain Engineering.

One of my main motivations backing this is : permanently moving to the EU.

Outside my office hours, I work on building stuff from scratch : like Operating Systems, Databases, WASM Runtimes, Container Interface Plugins, Ethereum node etc. in Rust / Zig / C, for educational purposes.

It's a long and hard journey. Being alone, makes it even harder!

I am gathering a few motivated people with similar mindset as of mine, into a group. I want the group to be small (10 - 15 members including me) and focused.

**Every Sunday, we meet and discuss with each other, whatever we've learnt (walk through the architecture and code, share the resources that we referenced, summarize chapters from a book etc.)**.

Being in a group, we motivate, get inspired and mutually benefit from each other.
